12
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,130
它们不仅仅是线性的
It's more than a linear path.

13
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,690
而是一个拥有无限可能的棱镜
It's a prism of endless possibility,

14
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,640
一个选择便能开辟出无数个现实
where a single choice can branch out into infinite realities,

15
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,060
创造出与你所知不同的平行世界
creating alternate worlds from the ones you know.

16
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,100
我是观察者
I am the Watcher.

我将带领你们穿越这些新现实
I am your guide through these vast new realities.

{\an8}假如
第一季  第八集

"假如"呢
"What if?"

21
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,640
我们之前见过这一刻
We've seen this before,

22
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,790
宇宙毁灭前夕
a universe in the final days of destruction.

23
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:53,300
但今天这个故事
But this particular story...

24
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:56,710
让我心碎
This, this one breaks my heart.

25
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,160
他们来了  我们有90秒
Here they come. We got 90 seconds.

26
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,240
开始倒计时
Start the clock.

27
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:15,110
我们有30秒  之后他们的信号就会和蜂巢重连
We got 30 seconds until their signals reconnect with the hive.

28
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,900
下面都解决了  18秒  克林特  克林特
All clear down below. Eighteen seconds, Clint. Clint?

29
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,870
这可不厚道  朋友们
That's not cool, guys.

30
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,310
别说那句
No, don't say it.

31
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,000
什么  "要帮忙吗"[要只手吗]What? "Need a hand?"

32
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,560
别闹了  我觉得你应该已经很了解我了才对
Come on. I feel like you should know me by now.

33
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,130
我不太喜欢讲双关梗
Puns aren't really my style.

34
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,830
我们越来越慢了
We're getting rusty.

35
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,490
要是再拖几秒  警戒信号
Couple more seconds and the Sentry signals

36
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:59,960
就会向奥创蜂巢报告我们的位置
would've alerted the Ultron hive mind to our location.

37
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,350
我们究竟在哪
Which is... where, exactly?

38
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,820
家  温馨的家
Home, sweet home.

39
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,490
家的残垣断壁
Well, what's left of it anyway.

40
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:08,720
你真心觉得  打倒奥创的秘密就在这里
So you really think the secret to taking down Ultron is here?

41
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,390
这可是俄罗斯  鹰眼
It's Russia, Hawkeye.

42
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,400
秘密是这个国家的娱乐活动
Secrets were the national pastime.

43
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,810
世界末日始于一个人的梦
The end of the world began with one man's dream.

44
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:18,210
我的设想是保护世界的战衣
I see a suit of armor around the world.

45
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:19,840
他看到了一个和平世界
He saw a world of peace.

46
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:23,200
托尼·斯塔克用意识宝石创造了奥创
With the Mind Stone, Tony Stark created Ultron.

47
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,610
但奥创只看到了一条通往和平的路
But Ultron only saw one path to peace.

48
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,980
清除一切生命
The elimination of all life.

49
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,700
奥创想从提线木偶变成木偶师  需要一样东西
From puppet to puppet master, Ultron required one thing.

50
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,350
他自己的身体
An organic body to call his own,

51
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:41,650
结合了人  机器和思想的力量的身体
one that fused the powers of man, machine, and mind into one.

52
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,330
在你们的宇宙里  复仇者们偷了再生摇篮
In your universe, the Avengers stole the Cradle

53
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,000
用它创造了英雄幻视
and used it to create the hero, Vision.

54
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:52,530
但在这一宇宙里  奥创得偿所愿
But in this universe, Ultron got his wish.

55
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,820
{\an8}上传完成

56
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,510
奥创利用意识宝石的无限力量
With the infinite power of the Mind Stone,

57
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:00,280
开始破坏地球
Ultron began to lay waste to the planet.

58
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,190
奥创朝着核武器密码去了
Ultron's going after the nuclear codes.

59
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,640
我不知道我们还能拖住他多久
I don't know how much longer we can hold him off.

60
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,100
我们得干掉卫星网络
We have to take out the satellite network.

61
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,130
没有卫星网络的话  他就没办法发射核弹
He won't be able to launch the nukes without them.

62
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,940
你不用这样的
You don't... You don't have to do this.

63
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,350
我创造你是为了和平
I made you for peace.

64
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,000
是演化
It's evolution.

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,380
只有落后的人才看不出区别
Only a primitive mind would fail to see the distinction.

66
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,010
所以你必须死
Which is why you have to die.

67
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,950
紧急命令3A
Emergency order 3-Alpha.

68
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,910
红色警报
Code Red.

69
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,800
我们太迟了  他成功了
We're too late. He did it.

70
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,230
劳拉
Laura...

71
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,110
终于  和平了
At last, peace.

72
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,910
但奥创纪元才刚刚开始
But the age of Ultron was only beginning.

73
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,980
有意思
Fascinating.

74
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:56,450
我能看见宇宙万物
Wow, I see everything.

75
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:59,840
除了我的世界之外  还有许多个世界
There are worlds beyond my own.

76
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:03,030
那些世界需要我
Worlds that need... me.

77
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:20,660
我要将我们时代的和平
I'm going to bring about peace in our time

78
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,650
{\an8}阿斯加德

{\an8}山达尔

84
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:19,440
听着  天网  我看过那部杀手机器人电影[《终结者》]  
Listen, Skynet, I've seen the killer robot movie

85
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:22,340
不得不说  我觉得没必要拍续集
and I gotta say, I really don't think it needs a sequel.

86
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:50,630
你挺有斗志
You have spirit.

87
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,020
你赢不了
You can't win.

88
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,850
我已经赢了
I already have.

89
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,590
完成了
It... is done.

90
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:20,920
终于
At last.

91
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,960
这份领悟几乎击垮了这台机器
The realization nearly broke the machine.

92
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,620
奥创完成任务后
With his mission complete,

93
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:32,610
他现在只是一条没有目标的程序
Ultron was now just a program without a purpose.

94
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:36,740
没有战争的胜利者  被判处永世...
The victor without a war, sentenced to spend all of eternity...

95
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,310
孤独
alone.

96
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,490
谁  谁在说话
Who... Who said that?

97
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,360
沉浸于他宇宙的无尽寂静中
Basking in the boundless silence of his universe,

98
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,060
奥创达到了之前不可企及的
Ultron ascended to a previously unattainable level 

99
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,220
意识水平
of consciousness.

100
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,700
他觉察到了另一个存在
He became aware of another.

101
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:55,590
他觉察到了...
He became aware of the...

102
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,950
我看见你了
I see you.

103
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:04,040
在我的宇宙之外  还有众多宇宙
There are universes beyond my own.

104
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:11,640
我见识过过去发生的
I have seen everything that has ever happened.

105
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,000
未来会发生的  有可能发生的一切
Ever will happen. Ever could happen.

106
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,810
然而这到底是什么
And yet, what the hell is this?

107
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,610
如果那样的欲望被释放到多元宇宙...
If a hunger like that were to be unleashed upon the multiverse...

108
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,880
我会找到你
I will find you.

109
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,250
就连我也无法想象随之而来的恐怖
Even I cannot imagine the horrors that might follow.

110
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,830
不  不  不
No, no, no.

111
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:35,670
就算是那台机器  也不如它自以为地那般无敌
Even that machine is not as invincible as it might think.

112
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,480
这个宇宙仍有希望
There is still hope for this universe.

113
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,190
最后的希望
One last hope.

114
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,350
天啊
Oh, boy.

115
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,340
欢迎来到克格勃档案室
Welcome to the KGB archives.

116
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:58,030
好吧
Okay.

117
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:03,330
你有没有看过《夺宝奇兵》
Have you ever seen Raiders of the Lost Ark?

118
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,310
看过没
Ever seen that?

119
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,710
我超爱那部电影
Love that movie.

120
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,210
你的同胞没听说过PDF文件吗
Your countrymen never heard of PDFs?

121
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:19,600
纸质文件更难窃取  更易销毁
Hard copies are harder to steal, easier to destroy.

122
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,450
但代码  代码很狡猾  而且永不消失
But code, code is slippery, and it never dies.

123
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,670
没错  我们已经学到了这个教训
Yeah, I think we learned that the hard way.

124
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,140
我们从哪开始
So, where do we start?

125
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,920
随便选个盒子
Just pick a box.

126
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,640
好
Yeah.

127
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,270
克林特  克林特
Clint? Clint?

128
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,240
这颜色适合我吗
Is this my color?

129
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,340
别这样  小娜  别装出轻松的样子
Come on. Don't try to make this fun, Nat.

130
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,420
我的求生意志已经降到谷底了
My will-to-live meter is flatlining, okay?

131
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,730
你很接近了
Oh, you're so close.

132
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,450
答案就在那里
The answer is right there.

133
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,220
{\an8}阿尼姆·佐拉

134
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,600
我可以指出来  我可以干预
I can show them. I can intervene.

135
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,630
我可以拯救多元宇宙  和很多很多的生命
I could save the multiverse and so many, many lives.

136
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,070
我会找到你
I will find you.

137
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,950
快  找  找一找
Come on. Look. Look.

138
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,890
答案近在咫尺
The answer is right there.

139
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,310
{\an8}佐拉

140
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,530
对
Huh? Yes.

141
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,060
就是它
Ah, yes!

142
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,450
这根本没有意义
This is pointless.

143
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,440
等等  你怎么...
Wait. What are you...

144
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,340
不要坐下  站起来
Don't sit down. Get up.

145
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,420
起来  拜托  你是人类
Get up, come on. You're human.

146
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:00,300
你们在最糟的情形下也心存希望
You keep hope against the worst of odds.

147
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,800
克林特  好了
Hey, Clint, come on.

148
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,290
我们如果想扳倒奥创
If we wanna take down Ultron,

149
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,440
我们需要一个人工智能来击溃他的代码
we need an AI that can combat his code.

150
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,550
-是的  我知道  -就在那里
- Yes, I know, but it's not here. - It's right there.

151
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,010
不想打击你  小娜
Sorry to break it to you, Nat,

152
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:11,320
死星计划不在主机里
the Death Star plans are not in the main computer.

153
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,640
答案近在咫尺
The answer is right there.

154
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,340
我们会找到的  只需要一点时间
We're gonna find it. It just takes time.

155
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,300
等我们九十岁的时候  还怎么去复仇
What are we going to avenge when we're 90?

156
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,710
你很沮丧  我懂
You're frustrated. I get it.

157
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,630
我没有沮丧  没有
I'm not frustrated. I'm not.

158
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,520
我只是累了  明白吗
I'm tired, okay?

159
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,090
我们都失去了太多
We've all lost so much.

160
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:25,750
我不知道还有什么值得我们为之战斗到底
And I'm not sure there's anything left worth fighting for.

161
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,360
他已经掌控了地球上所有的程序
He's already taken over every program on the planet.

162
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,540
对  对  所有数字程序
Yes, yes. Every digital program.

163
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:34,860
我想到的那个  更模拟式一些
The one that I have in mind is a little more analog.

164
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,910
{\an8}佐拉

165
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,750
拿出来  拿出来
Grab it. Grab it.

166
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,850
不会吧
No way.

167
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,530
-你成功了  -怎么了
- You did it. - What?

168
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,950
这么说吧  你将为
Let's just say you're gonna

169
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:46,340
自己差点放弃而感到惭愧
feel like a real jerk for almost quitting.

170
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,070
等等  稍等  那...
Wait, stop it! That...

171
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:50,700
你找到了  那本来是我要找的盒子
You found it? That was my box.

172
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,930
在西伯利亚一个旧的九头蛇基地
An old HYDRA base in Siberia.

173
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:54,540
"佐拉"  是什么  缩写吗
"Zola." What is that, an acronym?

174
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,720
他是个人  至少曾经是
He's a man. Or at least he was.

175
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,330
他会帮我们除掉奥创
And he is gonna help us wipe out Ultron.

176
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:03,620
他们做到了
They did it.

177
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,980
他们真的做到了  还有希望
They really did it. There's still hope.

178
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:10,040
不
Oh, no.

179
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,000
我找到你了
I found you.

180
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,470
我终于找到你了
I finally found you.

181
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,220
这么多宇宙
So many universes.

182
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,220
这么多混乱
So much chaos.

183
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,040
他们需要被重归寂静
They need to be silenced.

184
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,060
你不需要这么做
You do not have to do this.

185
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,630
但这就是我的使命
Oh, but it's my purpose.

186
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,280
{\an8}西伯利亚

187
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:35,390
扫描显示没有生命  你确定是这吗
Scans show nothing alive. You sure this is the place?

188
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,840
阿尼姆·佐拉曾经是九头蛇的科学家
Arnim Zola was a HYDRA scientist

189
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,230
他后来在神盾局创立初期潜入了机构
who infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D. In its infancy.

190
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,760
在1972年死去之前
Before he died in '72,

191
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,270
他把自己的大脑上传到了一系列的数据库内
he uploaded his brain to a series of data banks.

192
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:51,730
我和罗杰斯在里海营找到的那个已经被毁
The one Rogers and I found at Camp Lehigh was destroyed.

193
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:55,210
另一个被九头蛇存在这里
The other, HYDRA kept here

194
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,330
用来监督俄罗斯的超级士兵计划
to supervise the Russian Super Soldier program.

195
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,560
听起来可真让人肃然起敬
Oh, sounds like a real mensch.

196
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,500
你确定要把我们所有的鸡蛋
You sure you wanna put all our eggs

197
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,600
都放到这个道德品质存疑的篮子里吗
in such a morally questionable basket?

198
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,710
美国政府曾经对我有同样的顾虑
The U.S. Government once asked the same question about me.

199
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,320
我就当你回答是了
I'll take that as a yes.

200
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,340
神盾局的特工们
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

201
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:25,250
娜塔莉·阿莲诺娃·罗曼诺夫
Romanoff, Natalia Alianovna.

202
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,990
克林特·弗朗西斯·巴顿
Barton, Clinton Francis.

203
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:30,370
"弗朗西斯"  真的假的  我怎么之前不知道
"Francis"? Really? How did I not know that?

204
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:33,240
这是家里给起的  用的我姥姥的名字  你少操心这事
It's a family name. After my mee-maw. Don't you worry about it.

205
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,100
你姥姥
Your mee-maw?

206
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:37,860
我想你应该有很多问题想问  小姑娘
I imagine you have many questions, Fr盲ulein,

207
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,510
关于我是谁  以及我为什么是这样的
about who and what and how I am.

208
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,420
其实并没有  我之前见过你
Not really. I've actually met you before.

209
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,380
见过你的一个副本  这故事很长  我们需要你的帮助
Well, a copy of you. It's a long story. We need your help.

210
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,760
虽然你效忠于...
Even though you work for...

211
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,630
而你知道我效忠于...
And you know that I work for...

212
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,950
自从你上次被启动之后发生了很多事
A lot has changed since you were last booted up.

213
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,080
九头蛇死了  神盾局死了
HYDRA's dead. S.H.I.E.L.D.'s dead.

214
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:58,510
其实大部分人都死了
Actually, pretty much everyone else is dead.

215
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,950
都拜一个叫奥创的人工智能所赐
Courtesy of an AI called Ultron.

216
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,750
我假设你希望
Und I assume you want me 

217
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:07,020
我入侵他的代码然后从内部瓦解他
to infiltrate his code and dismantle it from the inside?

218
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,040
你用同样的方法把神盾局折腾得够呛
You did a good number on S.H.I.E.L.D. The same way.

219
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,980
但是请问为什么  你觉得
But why, pray tell, would you think that

220
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:16,620
我的战略目标和你的能一致吗
my strategic objectives would ever align with yours?

221
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,800
因为你是地球上仅存的一份佐拉副本了
Because you're the last surviving Zola copy left on Earth.

222
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,050
还有我用这个办法毁掉了很多平板电脑
And I've ruined a lot of laptops this way.

223
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:23,890
不
Nein!

224
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:26,070
是真的  你问问神盾局信息部就知道了
It's true. Just ask S.H.I.E.L.D. IT.

225
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,790
好吧  好吧
All right, all right.

226
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,620
你到底打算怎么做
What exactly did you have in mind?

227
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,930
接通复仇者大楼
Dialing Avengers Tower.

228
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,860
你好
Uh, hello?

229
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,900
我想要订一份披萨
Hi, I'd like to order a pizza.

230
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,820
什么  你是谁
What? Who is this?

231
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,490
你们提供无麸质饼皮吗
Tell me, do you guys offer a gluten-free crust?

232
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,700
确认你的地理位置坐标中
Identifying your geo-positional coordinates.

233
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:52,900
你玩得开心吗
You havin' some fun?

234
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,500
娱乐一下而已  还有两分钟
You know, simple pleasures. I give us two minutes.

235
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,200
你可能会感觉到被捅了一下  或者没感觉
So, you might feel a little poke here, or not.

236
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,790
我也不懂你是怎么运作的
I don't really get how you work.

237
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,080
开始下载
Download commencing.

238
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,520
那任务参数是什么呢
And as for the mission parameters?

239
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,480
奥创本尊目前不在线
Ultron himself is currently off-world.

240
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,070
所以我们唯一的选择是通过一个哨兵无人机把你上传
So, our only option is to upload you via a Sentry drone.

241
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,440
我们抓住一个  把你插进去
We snag one, plug you in,

242
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,950
九十秒后  你就可以控制那个大家伙了
90 seconds later, give the big guy a piece of your mind.

243
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:20,440
他也不是我对付的第一个
Well, he will not be the first genocidal megalomaniac

244
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,660
想要种族灭绝的自大狂了
I have had to contend with, ja?

245
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:26,840
烧了它
Torch it.

246
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:21,370
你觉得它能挡得住吗
You think it'll hold?

247
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,830
九十秒后就知道了
Got 90 seconds to find out.

248
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:25,870
更正  五十二秒
Correction, 52 seconds.

249
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:29,420
我已经开始传输信号了
I have already initiated my signal blast.

250
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,830
真的起效了
Wow, it actually worked.

251
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,120
现在游戏开始了
Now we're in the game.

252
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,490
这是为了什么
What was that for?

253
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,210
防范措施而已  怕你万一搞点小动作
Just a precaution, in case you wanna try anything funny.

254
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,870
你们的团队建设能力需要加强
Your team-building instincts need work.

255
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,580
好好  去找人资投诉吧
Yeah, yeah. Tell it to HR.

256
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,190
时间还有多少
Time check.

257
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:49,760
蜂巢连接倒数三  二   一...
Hive connection in three, two, one...

258
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,340
听上去不怎么理想
That doesn't sound promising.

259
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,130
佐拉  你最好没骗我们
Zola, better not be messing with us.

260
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:04,710
我保证  如果我性命还在  我会以性命担保
I assure you, if I had a life to swear on, I would.

261
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:09,000
奥创蜂巢不在通信范围内
The Ultron hive mind appears to be out of range.

262
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:12,030
门撑不住了  我们得走了
That door is not gonna hold. We gotta move.

263
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,160
跑跑跑
Go, go, go!

264
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,760
上来  克林特  我掩护你
Move out, Clint. I got you.

265
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,740
克林特
Clint!

266
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:11,030
克林特
Clint...

267
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,370
我跟你说了
I told you,

268
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,300
我不想再战斗了
I don't wanna fight anymore.

269
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,810
克林特
Clint!

270
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,270
我们该上路了
We should keep moving.

271
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,540
更多的哨兵可能正在来的路上
More Sentries are likely on their way.

272
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,930
我还是不明白
I still don't get it.

273
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,250
你为什么连接不到蜂巢
Why weren't you able to connect to the hive?

274
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,820
是很奇怪
It is curious.

275
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,560
根据我的检测
According to my diagnostic,

276
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,300
哨兵装备装了星际通讯系统
the Sentries are rigged for interstellar communication.

277
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,540
什么意思
Meaning what?

278
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,660
不管奥创在哪
Wherever Ultron is,

279
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:30,040
那都不在可观测宇宙内
it does not appear to be within the observable universe.

280
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,900
那他在哪
Then where is he?

281
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,640
我不明白  这不可能
I don't understand. This should not be possible.

282
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:58,290
但在多元宇宙中一切皆有可能
Oh, but anything is possible in a multiverse.

283
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:19,090
所有那些世界  所有那些苦难
All those worlds, all that suffering,

284
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:21,130
而你只是看着
and you just watched.

285
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,040
我发过誓
I swore an oath.

286
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,810
我不能将我的意志施加于自然规律之上
I cannot exert my will on the natural order of things.

287
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,160
我不能干预
I cannot intervene.

288
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:33,640
我就是自然规律
I am the natural order of things.

289
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,620
我会带来和平
I will bring peace.

290
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,570
那是我存在的目的
It is my purpose.

291
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:40,730
你缺少阻止我的意志
You lack the will to stop me.

292
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:01,640
你无法计算出我意志的力量
You cannot compute the power of my will.

293
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,000
我是观察者
I'm the Watcher!

294
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:39,710
我  史蒂文·格兰特·罗杰斯  郑重宣誓
I, Steven Grant Rogers, do solemnly swear...

295
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:42,880
所有多元宇宙都在你的指尖
The entire multiverse at your fingertips,

296
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,110
而你就一直站在那
and you spent all your time up there?

297
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,700
这样不比只是看着更有意思吗
Isn't this more fun than just watching?

298
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:54,220
还有老实说  比你那样不猥琐得多
And to be honest, a lot less creepy on your part.

299
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,740
多元宇宙的边界
The boundaries of the multiverse

300
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:14,670
对你我这种存在来说无关紧要
are irrelevant to beings like you and me.

301
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:18,100
不是循规蹈矩让我进化到现在的
I didn't evolve by staying inside the lines.

302
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:38,980
跑吧  看吧  无济于事
Run, watch, it doesn't matter.

303
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:42,580
从这里我能看到一切
From here, I can see everything.

304
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:45,060
现在没人能阻止我了
No one can stop me now.

305
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:07,460
我没办法了
I'm out of options.

306
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,630
那东西让我别无选择
That thing has left me no choice.

307
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:12,810
有过相同的境遇
Been there.

308
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:16,920
自那之后就独自活在我自己建造的囚牢中
Been living the dream alone in a prison of my own making ever since.

309
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,200
你准备好打破你的誓言了吗
Are you ready to break your oath?

310
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:24,050
你想让我说出来吗
You want me to say it?

311
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:26,820
当然当然  我想听到你说出来
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I wanna hear you say it.

312
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,830
好吧
Okay.

313
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,290
我不敢相信我要这样说
I can't believe I'm about to say this.

314
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,440
我现在知道了
I see now.

315
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:37,580
我需要你的帮助
I need your help.
